/*
 *      LEVEL SYSTEM
 * 
 *  Implement some sort of level system with waves
 *  Waves can have prefabs / enums / something you can choose to spawn from a dropdown
 *  They are spawned with a rule that's dragged into a slot
 *  The spawning rule contains data on where to spawn things, stuff like only on edges, but can also contain more unique stuff
 * 
 * 
 *  Look into non-gameobject scripts that can hold prefabs and other scripts
 *  Look into scriptable objects
 *  Look into example systems from defining level generation for games
 *
