/*
 * 
 *      ZOOM OUT FOR FURTHER LEVELS -> DONE
 *      
 *  Implement a system where the game can zoom in or out, and level bounds are updated with this change. 
 *  Also look into supporting changing aspect ratios (e.g. windowed game's size is changed), and check if 
 *  changing window size can cause objects to be pushed beyond the screen limits. 
 * 
 * 
 *      CHANNELS (sound, music, game logic)
 * 
 *  Implement Scriptable Object -based channels using Events ( the => () stuff) which let objects send messages to 
 *  other objects / scripts in a generic, neutral way, e.g. start sounds, stop sounds, keep playing sounds and music 
 *  while scene changes, send asteroid created/destroyed information without referencing or knowing about the GameManager.
 * 
 * 
 *      LEVEL SYSTEM
 * 
 *  Implement some sort of level system with waves
 *  Waves can have prefabs / enums / something you can choose to spawn from a dropdown
 *  They are spawned with a rule that's dragged into a slot
 *  The spawning rule contains data on where to spawn things, stuff like only on edges, but can also contain more unique stuff
 * 
 * 
 *  Look into example systems from defining level generation for games
 *
